# Speech-Recognition-Alexis

This project was made by me, Alexis is a speech recognition app. Till now I have built Speech to Text, but in future there will be more versions for this. The one I have uploaded right now, is containing features like find location, search on google, checking current time. Alexis right now can only reply in text back in terminal, it's functions are like other speech recognition apps but its just that it cannot speak right now. I am looking into that and there will be soon a new version.

I hope you like the project :)
